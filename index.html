    <p class="background">I was 18 when I moved abroad for my studies. I wasn’t scared—in fact, I was excited to meet new people,
         travel, and have new adventures. However, six months into my studies, COVID hit the world, and we were suddenly in lockdown. 
         It felt like a major roadblock to my 18-year-old dream of exploring new places.</p>
    <p class="background">Life works in strange ways. It didn’t just come to a halt for me, but also for other international students around me.
         Like me, they couldn’t travel home or go to the places they had hoped to visit.
          So, during that lockdown, far from our families, we created a new home for ourselves.</p>
    <p class="background">Instead of traveling, we cooked food to experience each other’s cultures.
         We shared stories from our roots and learned life lessons over cups of hot ginger tea. 
         That lockdown was difficult—we lost loved ones we couldn’t say a final goodbye to—but
          we also formed a close-knit community, a bond that will last a lifetime.</p>
    <p class="background">The following recipes are some of my favorites, shared with me by my friends who are now in different corners of the world. 
        I want to keep them with me forever. Over time, I’ll add more recipes as 
        I continue working on my web development skills.</p>
    <p class="background">I hope you enjoy them as much as I did &#x2661; </p>

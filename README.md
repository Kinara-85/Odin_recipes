# Odin Recipes

This is my first project in The Odin Project's Foundations course.

In this project, I will build a basic recipe website using only HTML.  
By the end, Iâ€™ll have practiced:
- Creating HTML pages
- Linking pages together
- Using Git for version control
- Writing meaningful commit messages

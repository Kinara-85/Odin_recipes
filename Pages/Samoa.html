        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>4–6 slices of bread or papya bread ( I have also seen my friend using sweet pumpkin bread, she made herself)</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for toasting/frying</li>
            <li>1 can (400ml) coconut milk</li>
            <li>¾ to 1 cup brown sugar (adjust to your sweetness)</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp vanilla (optional)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Bread:</strong>Lightly toast or fry the bread in a pan with a little butter or oil until golden on both sides.
                Set aside in a dish (you can tear or cut into chunks if you like).</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Coconut Caramel:</strong>In a saucepan, mix coconut milk + brown sugar + salt.
                Bring to a gentle boil, then simmer on low heat for about 15–20 minutes, stirring often, until it thickens into a sauce.
                Optional: Add a bit of vanilla for extra flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble:</strong>Pour the hot coconut caramel sauce over the toasted bread.
                Let it soak for a few minutes so the bread absorbs that goodness.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve Warm (or chilled if you like)</strong>The bread becomes soft and sweet, and the sauce is rich and coconutty with a caramel twist.</li>
        </ol>
